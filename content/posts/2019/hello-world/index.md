Salutations web citizen, welcome to my webzone. 

This blog will be used for talking about code, software development, Video Games, Movies, Music, Pok√©mon, and pretty much anything that is on my mind that I feel needs to be written about.

Not sure if I'll gain a following, but hopefully someone will read this and find this interesting.

The blog is based on [Gatsby's blog starter ](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog), which uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and allows me to make blog postings using Markdown.

I hope to have more time this summer to write, as I have lots to share with you all.
